            interface - blueprint (claases like in java and C++) and dont compare this interface with java's interface

            eventTarget - interface implemented by Object that can recieve events & may have listers for them
                            
                            methods : 1.addEventListner()
                                      2.removeEventListner()
                                      3.dispatchEvent()
            eventTarget <------ Node <-------Element

            1.addEventListner()
                                - we can listen to event   
                                - respond to event
                                - hook into event

                Pesudo code
                            <eventTarget>.addEventListner(<event-to-listen-for>, <function-to-run-when-event-happen>); 
                            - event-target
                            - event - type
                            - function

            2.removeEventListner()
